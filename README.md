# Project Overview
This project analyzes the snail data available in `Snail2.csv`. The main goal is to understand how the snail shell length (response variable) is related to other predictors and to build predictive models.

Key tasks include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Transformation and assessment of the response variable
- Simple and multiple linear regression
- Model selection and interaction exploration
- Prediction and interval estimation
- Bagging and Random Forest modeling
- Comparison of statistical learning methods

# Data Description
- Source: Morphometrics and phylogeography of the cave-obligate land snail *Helicodiscus barri* (Gastropoda, Stylommatophora, Helicodiscus)
- File: `Snail2.csv`
- Variables: Length (response) and several predictors (e.g., ShellType, other morphometric measurements)
